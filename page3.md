<h3>A little bit about Seville</h3>
<p>Seville offers a wide range of places to visit, the Cathedral of Seville is a must visit landmark in Seville. It's gothic architecture and history will amaze you.
  Another incredible attraction is La plaza de Espa√±a which is an amazing plaza that is full of colour, it is inspired by the traditional and reginal architecure. No wonder why it was given such a grand name.
 Another must visit is Las setas de Sevilla which translate to the mushrooms of Seville, this enormous and modern wooden strcuture is believed to be the largest in the world and it shows a more modern side to Seville.</p>
