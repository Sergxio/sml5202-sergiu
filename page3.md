<p>Seville is the capital of Andalusia which is an autonomous community that covers the whole of southern Spain. Seville is a standout city in Spain and it represents the Spanish culture in the best ways. It offers a wide range of historical landmarks such as the Cathedral of Seville and the Spanish square. We cannot forget about the famous flamenco music and dances that make the city come alive. Something that is also incredible is that the city has remained true to itself whilst adapting to the modern days. The amazing public transport system and modern architecture of many buildings demonstrate how it has evolved.</p
