      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Sergio. Welcome to this exciting journey! Hopefully, you will get something out of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I was a child I always found comfort in travelling and visiting new places. It was just a way to escape my daily life and have adventures and different experiences. Spain has always been very welcoming to me. It is full of culture, nice food and people from north to south. This time I will be focusing on Seville as I believe that it is a city that everyone should visit during their lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created this page as a guide for anyone who is thinking about visiting Seville and also to show my love for Seville and hopefully inspire you to visit it!&nbsp;</p>
